# Susquehanna International Group Algothon 2022 Submission
My team's third place submission for Susquehanna International Group's 2022 Algothon. 
Using Python, we generated a heatmap matrix using numpy to find correlated financial instruments across the historical synthetic given data.
We then implemented a mean reversion algorithm on correlated instruments seeing a 15% return across new unseen synthetic data.
Finally, a presentation was developed to showcase our algorithm, discuss our process, and explore strengths/weaknesses in our approach.
